    "# MODULE 2.3 - Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Protocols define the sequence of events between parties and the rules that are to be followed for the purpose of accomplishing some set of goals. Protocols can range from incredibly complex to incredibly simple. The key to evaluating protocols is do they meet their stated goals. A protocol to provide integrity may not provide confidentiality, which may be ok, if confidentiality is not important. When designing or selecting protocols it’s crucial to be aware of your assumptions and to identify the protocol's goals correctly and completely.\n",

    "Trustworthy Trent operates a timestamping service that provides proof of when a document was created. For example, suppose Alice has a document with supporting evidence for her patent application. Alice wants her document timestamped to prove when her designs existed. \n",
    "1. Alice transmits a copy of the document to Trent\n",
    "1. Trent records the date and time he received the document and stores that along with a copy of the document for reference.\n",
    "If anyone questions when the document was created, they could contact Trent who could verify the timestamp and that the document presented matches the document stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some security or operational concerns with this protocol?"
